Perfect Week is a web app that provides the user a week of restaurants and entertainment in any city the user picks.

The app is developed in Reactjs and CSS. 
The user needs to input a city in the home page. Then select any day of that week to see the details of the restaurant and entertainment planed for that day.

This app was made for people who wants to know the city they are in a lot better, with not only the tourist places, but the best ranked restaurant and venues.

To have the project you just need to clone the repo in your computer and npm install

I made this app with adrimonasterios, rsanmartin1991 and Grimnia
